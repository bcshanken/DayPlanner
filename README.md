## Instillation 

To  use this application you will need to fork and set up the index.html, script.js, and style.css files. Once you link them and host the files the application will run properly. You may view a deployed version of this application [here](https://bcshanken.github.io/DayPlanner/).
## Usage

When you load the application the current day will be displayed

You can edit the text fields for each hour by typing in the text area and then hitting save. 

The rows will change color as the  hour of the day progresses. Green will represent what is to come, red what is active, and grey for the past.
